The computer will guess a number between 1 and 1000 and and you need to guess the number.
Unlimited number of retries will be provided till you guess the correct number. The one with least number of retries wins the game.
The computer will give a hint to the user in case the player chooses a wrong number â€“ 
The computer will tell the player if target is within 0 and the number guessed by the user. For eg: If you choose 120 and the number is 24, 
the target number(24) lies between 0 and 120, so the computer will prompt accordingly.
